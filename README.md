# Mangacan AdsHidder
## Developed by Almantera Tiantana Al Faruqi

If you use some Ads Blocker extension for chrome but you're a manga reader in [Mangacan's site](http://mangacanblog.com) then you'll need this to get rid those modal that blocked you from reading the manga!

## How to use
1. Download by clicking [here](https://github.com/almanalfaruq/Mangacan-AdsHidder/archive/v1.1.zip).
2. Extract that downloaded zip.
3. Open Chrome. Copy this link `chrome://extensions/` . Paste to the chrome's address bar, press `enter`.
4. Click the `Developer mode` on the right side of the top menu. 
5. Drag the folder that you extract to the chrome.
6. Go to [Mangacan's site](http://mangacanblog.com) or refresh the Mangacan's page.

## Note
If you have been warned by chrome to disable your `Developer mode`, it's just a false positive. I'm just trying to help you, not to destroy your computer/laptop.
